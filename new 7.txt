Deleted /.tmp directory
checked hbase-site.xml, everything looks good there
but not able to find logs for hbase 
when i run jps command, not able to find hmaster process


Access to c code and sample schema or any sample of the final xml file that needs to be loaded. The location of gcs bucket where the xml files are there.
Are we getting the data in json or xml
Do we need to apply the rules once after we load the data into bq or before that
Access to gcs, c code, bq, dataFlow, 

Basic Idea:
2 tasks:
1.Schema creation:
For schema, we want sample file 
will have to make sure if its json or xml 
Naming convention for creation of table (archived and non archived)
Do we need to create two tables with similar schema or 
the archival table will have different schema ?
Do we need to automate creation of empty table in big query 




How will the provider files be updated in the bucket. Will they update sequentially or all at a time. 

If they are updating at a time then do we need to read all those file paths wherever the files are added and process them.

Should I create an empty table based out of fields given in  json file ? Or we can create bq table on the fly while loading json files ?
Should I need to automate it (creation of empty table) ?
We load json file in big query ,we would call this staging table 
 then hwo do we need to create archived(master) table in bq ?
 What parameters need to be considered before archiving ?
